Gator: FidoNet echomail gateway software

Gator was written in 1994 during the peak of FidoNet. This was a time when
there were also many FidoNet-compatible "othernets", when I thought it
would be interesting to write software to gate echomail between these
networks. At the time I'd just begun learning C language (previously I'd
used Turbo Pascal exclusively) and so this project became something I could
work on to improve my knowledge of C. Consequently the code is a bit rough
around the edges.

While the software did work, it was very niche! There were plans to turn
Gator into a more complete mail processor similar to SquishMail, though
ultimately SquishMail did what I needed so there was no real motivation to
duplicate it.

The source code to Gator never saw a public release until years later in
2012, long after most FidoNet bulletin boards had closed down due to the
rise of the Internet. Still, I thought it was an interesting slice of
FidoNet history worth archiving.
